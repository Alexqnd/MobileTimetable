# MobileTimetable
A simple local HTML timetable for mobile browsers

This repository will be archived after this commit for following reasons:
- Me not having time to work on it
- Me not needing it really since I can just use the timetable from my uni and note any changes in my calendar
- It would take too much time to copy from an existing timetable and keep it updated with it
- Unstability due to error while copying from an existing timetable
